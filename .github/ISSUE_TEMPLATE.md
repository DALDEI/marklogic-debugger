### So you need help Debugging the debugger, eh?

Help me maximize this ticket's value.

#### The issue

Short description of the problem:

What behavior are you expecting?

#### Tech details

Which Operating System are you using?

Which version of MarkLogic are you using?

Which version of the MarkLogic Debugger are you using?

Which browser are you using?

#### The devil is in the details...

If possible, rerun the command with -d for debugging output and attach the output:

  **for quickstart:**  
  `java -jar marklogic-debugger.war -d > myoutput.txt`

  **for gradle:**  
  `gradle mlYourCommand -d > myoutput.txt`
